# Discord-Encrypto Infomration
This Discord bot provides users with the ability to encrypt and decrypt messages and images within Discord. Leveraging the power of Discord's API and Python's Discord library, this bot offers a secure and convenient way for users to communicate sensitive information or share encrypted images.

# Features 
- Message Encryption/Decryption: Users can encrypt messages using a unique encryption key tied to their Discord username. The bot then decrypts these messages when provided with the correct key, ensuring secure communication.
- Image Encryption/Decryption: Users can encrypt images by providing a URL, with decryption keys generated and stored securely. Encrypted images can be decrypted on request, ensuring privacy and security when sharing sensitive visuals.
- Key Management: Users can manage their encryption and decryption keys, listing all current keys associated with their account for both messages and images.
